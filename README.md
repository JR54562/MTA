# Music Tracker App or MTA.

MTA is an app that allows a user to first sign-up for a profile, and then add songs to a collection. 

## Installation

No installation is required. A profile can be created on the main page initially.

## Usage

In order to use the app, a user will need to register the first time and then only login on subsequent visits.

Once logged in, a user can edit the username and password of their profile, add songs, search or view all songs in the database. The logged in user will also be able to see any songs they have added, and take action on them.

## Project Structure

One database with two tables is used to track users and songs. There is a foreign relationship to enable song tracking by user.
